# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction App  

An **AI-powered web application** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that predicts the likelihood of **breast cancer** using clinical tumor characteristics. This app is designed as a **support tool** to assist individuals and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about breast health.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This app is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a licensed healthcare provider for medical concerns.  

---

## 📌 Features  

- 🧪 **Breast Cancer Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on input tumor features.  
- 💡 **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides lifestyle and health guidance based on risk.  
- 📘 **FAQs Section**: Answers common questions about breast cancer and the app.  
- 🎨 **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, interactive, and easy-to-use design powered by Streamlit and streamlit-extras.  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Input Clinical Data**  
   - Users enter tumor-related features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and symmetry.  

2. **AI Prediction**  
   - The pre-trained model (`breast_cancer_model1.sav`) predicts whether the tumor is likely **benign (No Breast Cancer)** or **malignant (Breast Cancer Detected)**.  

3. **Recommendations**  
   - Depending on the result, the app provides tailored lifestyle, health, and emotional support recommendations.  

4. **Knowledge Support**  
   - The **FAQ tab** educates users about breast cancer, model accuracy, data privacy, and next steps after a positive result.
