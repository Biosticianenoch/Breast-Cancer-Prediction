    ### üëã Hello!
    This application uses a trained machine learning model to assist in the **early detection of breast cancer** based on tumor characteristics.

    #### üìå What You Can Do Here:
    - Enter tumor measurements under the **Diagnosis** tab.
    - Get instant prediction results (Malignant or Benign).
    - Read personalized health **Recommendations**.
    - Explore common **FAQs** related to breast health.
